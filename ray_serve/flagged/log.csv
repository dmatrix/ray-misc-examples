"HOUSTON -- Men have landed and walked on the moon. Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their fragile four-legged lunar module safely and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time. Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old commander, radioed to earth and the mission control room here: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" The first men to reach the moon -- Armstrong and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. of the Air Force -- brought their ship to rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the arid Sea of Tranquility. About six and a half hours later, Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch, stepped slowly down the ladder and declared as he planted the first human footprint on the lunar crust: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as a television camera outside the craft transmitted his every move to an awed and excited audience of hundreds of millions of people on earth.",,,,2023-02-22 16:14:29.492248

Ray distributed framework and Ray Serve,"Ray distributed framework and Ray Serve is an open-source open source framework for creating and managing apps using Python, Perl and C++.

It builds and runs on an OSX/Linux desktop machine, with a Java VM installed on each. It is based off of the OpenWRT toolkit; it's also used to build and run a lot of Java and C#/JavaScript-related systems, such as servers, web apps, and other types of applications.

Fluid distribution and containerized delivery

We can create a fluid flow through containers to use Ray distributed framework/Containerized Delivery scheme.

How to create Ray Distribution Framework and Distributed Delivered Protocol/Method

In this example, we will create a new fluid distribution/Containerized Delivery scheme using Ray Distributor Protocol. The scheme is based on the TCP protocol, and is using the WebRTC protocol.
